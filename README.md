# ANN Algorithms
This repo contains some artificial neural network algorithms for classic problema as truth table, Iris dataset and Wine dataset.

The algorithms implemented here are:

Perceptron and Adaline.

Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) with holdout cross-validation.

Hopfield Network.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).
